## Context

Hello!

I don’t think I can emphasize this enough—spearheading a design system is hard. I wouldn’t just call it a challenge or an exciting project. It’s tough, especially when you’re working within an existing product ecosystem that lacks a seamless experience.

For the past 10 years, we never really redesigned anything. Instead, we kept building on top of an already crumbling foundation—patching things up, adding new features, and stacking more complexity onto an unstable base. Over time, the inconsistencies grew, and the cracks in our design started to show. What should have been a seamless experience became fragmented. Users navigating between different modules—whether HR, payroll, or a full-suite platform—felt like they were moving between completely different products. The lack of cohesion wasn’t just an inconvenience; it was actively harming the user experience.

That’s when we decided to go against the flow. With the help of other "rascal" people (frontend engineers) but who actually cares to the products, we pushed for something bigger—a unified design system. Not just a fresh coat of paint, but a structural overhaul. One that doesn’t rely on mdbootstrap or scattered third-party libraries but instead creates a strong, scalable foundation that will support the product for years to come. A system where every page, every interaction, and every feature feels consistent, whether you're using a single module or the full ecosystem.

This isn’t just about aesthetics or efficiency—it’s about customer experience. For too long, our users saw our products as something they simply had to use. It was functional, it got the job done, but it was never delightful. That’s what we’re changing. This redesign isn’t just about usability; it’s about creating a product experience that feels effortless, intuitive, and even enjoyable.

Spearheading this shift wasn’t easy. It meant challenging long-standing workflows, convincing stakeholders, and breaking away from old habits. But in the end, I knew it was the right thing to do. A solid design system isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s the only way forward if we want to build something that truly lasts.

This is our story—the story of taking the risk, breaking free from the past, and creating something better.
